# Build a Website from Scratch
I've been feeling like I've running before I've learned to walk with regards to web development.  

So I've decided to take a step back and relearn how to build a simple website without any bootstrap help. Basically relearning the ropes.  
By following a guide, I am hoping to achieve a more methodical approach towards building a website. I think I really lack in the CSS department so it really helps to know what each attributes does what and it's pretty satisfying to say so far.  

The Youtube guide is [Build An HTML5 Website with A Responsive Layout by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw).  
His guide is pretty straight forward and doesn't require much other explanation. 

That is all for now.
